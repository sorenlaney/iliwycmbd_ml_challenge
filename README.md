### Model

I tried 3 different models before settling on on a gradient boosted tree. Here is some example code of those models of working on those models.

```
# Train models.

dtc = DecisionTreeClassifier(labelCol = "isev_indexed",
                            featuresCol = "features")

rf = RandomForestClassifier(labelCol = "isev_indexed",
                            featuresCol = "features",
                            numTrees = 15)

gbt = GBTClassifier(labelCol = "isev_indexed",
                            featuresCol = "features")



# Chain indexers, vectorizers, and random forest in a Pipeline
pipeline_dtc = Pipeline(stages = [labelToIndex, vector_assembler, dtc])
pipeline_rf = Pipeline(stages = [labelToIndex, vector_assembler, rf])
pipeline_gbt = Pipeline(stages = [labelToIndex, vector_assembler, gbt])

# Run each step in the pipeline.
# Train model. This also runs the indexers.
model_dtc = pipeline_dtc.fit(trainingData)
model_rf = pipeline_rf.fit(trainingData)
model_gbt = pipeline_gbt.fit(trainingData)

```


### Model performance

#### Train Data 

Accuracy: 75.87%             
Test Error: 24.13%             

#### Test Data

Accuracy: 76.32%             
Test Error: 23.68%   

#### Colrado Data

Accuracy: 77.88%             
Test Error: 22.12%   


#### Feature Importance

We can see the top ten features of the ranked from top to bottom in the graph below. We can see that most important feature, the number of hotels, has a lot of weight in detiriming whether or not a tract has an EV charger in it. This most likely because many EV companies. that build these chargers at or near hotels to accomedate for those who want to take their electric vehicle arcoss the country on a multi-day trip. We can then see that the total number of starbucks is the next largest indicator on whether or not an EV charger is in that track, contributing to 18% of feature importance in the model.

I wasn't happy with my model but we cannot dwell on the past, nor can we control the future. It is but today alone for our dominion, and ill be darned if I dont make the most of it!
